Agriculture is regarded as a crucial component of the global economy and provides for one of humankind's most fundamental needs, namely food. Lack of knowledge about soil types, yields, crops, weather, poor use of pesticides, irrigation issues, incorrect harvesting, and ignorance of market trends resulted in the loss of farmers or increased costs. Applications of computer vision and the machine learning will help to enhance productivity, improve quality, and ultimately increase the employability of farmers and related industries. Generalized classification of agricultural tasks are pre-harvesting, harvesting and post-harvesting. In this report, we focus on pre-harvesting stage of dry bean which relates to seedsâ€™ types and qualities. The images of beans were taken in a controlled environment with a specific camera and noise on the images was cleared using specific methods on MATLAB R2016a. for 13,611 samples from 236 images, 12 dimensional and 4 shape features were measured one by one for each sample. These features include, area, perimeter, major and minor axis length, aspect ratio, eccentricity, convex area, equivalent diameter, extent, solidity, roundness, compactness and 4 shape factors. By using these features and Turkish Standard Institute, images were classified in 7 types of dry beans, namely, Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz and Sira. Therefore, this dataset has 13611 rows, 16 columns of features (input) and one column of labels (output).
